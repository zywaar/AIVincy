# Active Context: Brick Ball Game

## Current Work Focus
**Status**: Memory Bank initialization complete - ready to begin development

**Immediate Priority**: Create the foundational game structure with basic HTML5 Canvas setup and core game classes.

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Created complete Memory Bank structure
- ✅ Defined project scope and requirements
- ✅ Established technical architecture and patterns
- ✅ Set up development approach and constraints

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. **Create index.html**: Basic HTML structure with Canvas element
2. **Setup Canvas Context**: Initialize 2D rendering context
3. **Implement Game Loop**: RequestAnimationFrame-based update/render cycle
4. **Create Core Classes**: Ball, Paddle, Brick, and Game controller classes

### Phase 2: Basic Gameplay
1. **Paddle Control**: Mouse/keyboard input for paddle movement
2. **Ball Physics**: Basic movement and wall collision
3. **Brick Layout**: Create initial brick arrangement
4. **Collision Detection**: Ball-paddle and ball-brick interactions

### Phase 3: Game Logic
1. **Scoring System**: Points for brick destruction
2. **Lives System**: Ball loss and game over conditions
3. **Win Condition**: All bricks destroyed
4. **Game States**: Menu, playing, game over screens

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Single File Approach**: All code in index.html for simplicity
- **Canvas Size**: 800x600 pixels for good visibility and performance
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript implementation
- **Class-Based Architecture**: ES6 classes for clean code organization

### Design Considerations
- **Color Scheme**: Bright, contrasting colors for good visibility
- **Paddle Size**: Large enough for control, small enough for challenge
- **Ball Speed**: Fast enough for excitement, slow enough for control
- **Brick Layout**: Traditional rectangular grid pattern

### Performance Priorities
- **60fps Target**: Smooth gameplay is essential
- **Efficient Collision**: Simple but accurate detection algorithms
- **Memory Management**: Avoid object creation in game loop
- **Canvas Optimization**: Minimize drawing operations

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Pattern
```javascript
// Class definitions first
class Game { }
class Ball { }
class Paddle { }
class Brick { }

// Utility functions
function checkCollision() { }
function gameLoop() { }

// Game initialization
const game = new Game();
gameLoop();
```

### Collision Detection Approach
- **AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)**: Simple rectangular collision
- **Circle-Rectangle**: Ball (circle) vs Paddle/Bricks (rectangles)
- **Reflection Calculation**: Proper bounce angles based on collision surface

### State Management Pattern
- **Enum-like Constants**: GAME_STATES = { MENU: 0, PLAYING: 1, ... }
- **State-Specific Logic**: Switch statements in update/render methods
- **Clean Transitions**: Clear entry/exit logic for each state

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Success Factors
1. **Accurate Collision Detection**: This will make or break the game feel
2. **Responsive Controls**: Paddle movement must feel immediate and precise
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of hits, scores, and game state
4. **Performance Consistency**: Maintain smooth framerate throughout

### Potential Challenges
- **Ball-Paddle Physics**: Getting realistic and fun bounce behavior
- **Edge Cases**: Ball getting stuck or behaving unexpectedly
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across browsers
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Future consideration for touch controls

### Development Philosophy
- **Start Simple**: Get basic functionality working first
- **Iterate Quickly**: Test frequently in browser
- **Focus on Feel**: Prioritize game feel over visual polish initially
- **Document Decisions**: Keep Memory Bank updated with learnings

## Current Environment
- **Working Directory**: c:/Dev/AIVincy
- **File Structure**: Memory Bank complete, ready for game file creation
- **Development Mode**: ACT MODE - ready to implement
- **Next Action**: Create index.html with basic game structure
