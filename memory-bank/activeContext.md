## Next Steps

### Phase 5: AI Performance Tracking (Ready to Implement)
1. **Player Metrics Object**: Track ballsLost, bricksHit, totalBallBounces, paddleAccuracy
2. **Performance Calculation**: Implement accuracy percentage calculations
3. **Assistance Level Determination**: No Help (>60%), Subtle Help (30-60%), Active Help (<30%)
4. **Metrics Collection Integration**: Add tracking throughout gameplay

### Phase 6: AI Assistance Features (Ready to Implement)
1. **Subtle Physics Adjustments**: Larger paddle collision area for struggling players
2. **Smart Power-up Timing**: Increase drop rates and prioritize helpful power-ups
3. **Adaptive Ball Physics**: Minor speed/direction adjustments for struggling players
4. **Difficulty Balancing**: Ensure assistance is subtle and not obvious

### Phase 7: Polish & Final Testing
1. **AI System Testing**: Verify assistance levels work correctly
2. **Balance Adjustments**: Fine-tune assistance parameters
3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure 60fps with AI features
4. **Cross-browser Testing**: Final compatibility verification

## Memory Bank Improvements Made
- **Features Directory**: Created detailed documentation for AI assistance and power-ups
- **Development Directory**: Added code patterns, testing guide, and development workflow
- **Structured Documentation**: Better organization for feature development and maintenance
- **Code Templates**: Reusable patterns for consistent implementation
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive checklists for quality assurance

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- **REFACTORED**: Modular Architecture - Moved from single file to ES6 modules
- **Canvas Size**: 800x600 pixels for good visibility and performance
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript implementation
- **Enhanced Architecture**: ES6 modules with entity-component system
- **Testing Framework**: Browser-based testing with comprehensive coverage
- **Centralized Config**: GameConfig.js for easy modification
- **System-Based Logic**: Dedicated systems for complex features

### Design Considerations
- **Color Scheme**: Bright, contrasting colors for good visibility
- **Paddle Size**: Large enough for control, small enough for challenge
- **Ball Speed**: Fast enough for excitement, slow enough for control
- **Brick Layout**: Traditional rectangular grid pattern

### Performance Priorities
- **60fps Target**: Smooth gameplay is essential
- **Efficient Collision**: Simple but accurate detection algorithms
- **Memory Management**: Avoid object creation in game loop
- **Canvas Optimization**: Minimize drawing operations

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Pattern
```javascript
// Class definitions first
class Game { }
class Ball { }
class Paddle { }
class Brick { }

// Utility functions
function checkCollision() { }
function gameLoop() { }

// Game initialization
const game = new Game();
gameLoop();
```

### Collision Detection Approach
- **AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)**: Simple rectangular collision
- **Circle-Rectangle**: Ball (circle) vs Paddle/Bricks (rectangles)
- **Reflection Calculation**: Proper bounce angles based on collision surface

### State Management Pattern
- **Enum-like Constants**: GAME_STATES = { MENU: 0, PLAYING: 1, ... }
- **State-Specific Logic**: Switch statements in update/render methods
- **Clean Transitions**: Clear entry/exit logic for each state

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Success Factors
1. **Accurate Collision Detection**: This will make or break the game feel
2. **Responsive Controls**: Paddle movement must feel immediate and precise
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of hits, scores, and game state
4. **Performance Consistency**: Maintain smooth framerate throughout

### Potential Challenges
- **Ball-Paddle Physics**: Getting realistic and fun bounce behavior
- **Edge Cases**: Ball getting stuck or behaving unexpectedly
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across browsers
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Future consideration for touch controls

### Development Philosophy
- **Start Simple**: Get basic functionality working first
- **Iterate Quickly**: Test frequently in browser
- **Focus on Feel**: Prioritize game feel over visual polish initially
- **Document Decisions**: Keep Memory Bank updated with learnings

## CORS Issue Resolution - Critical Learning

### Problem Identified (2025-01-11)
- **Issue**: `index-modular.html` was unresponsive when opened directly in browser
- **Root Cause**: CORS policy blocking ES6 module imports from `file://` protocol
- **Symptoms**: Black canvas, no JavaScript execution, Space key causing page scroll
- **Error**: "Access to script at 'file:///C:/Dev/AIVincy/src/main.js' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy"

### Solution Implemented
- **HTTP Server Setup**: Used `npx serve . -p 8000` (served on port 52027)
- **Access URL**: `http://localhost:52027/index-modular.html`
- **Result**: All ES6 modules loading correctly, game fully responsive
- **Verification**: Ball physics, collision detection, scoring, lives system all functional

### Development Workflow Update
- **Local Development**: Always use HTTP server for ES6 modules
- **Server Command**: `npx serve . -p 8000` (or available port)
- **Testing**: Both game and test runner accessible via HTTP
- **Browser Console**: Clean loading with all modules successful

## Current Environment
- **Working Directory**: c:/Dev/AIVincy
- **File Structure**: Clean modular ES6 architecture with comprehensive testing framework
- **Development Mode**: HTTP server required for ES6 modules
- **Game Status**: **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - All systems verified working after cleanup
- **HTTP Server**: Running on `http://localhost:52988`
- **Main Files**: 
  - `index.html` - **SINGLE MODULAR VERSION** - Main game entry point (requires HTTP server)
  - `tests/test-runner.html` - Comprehensive test suite (18 tests, 16 passing)
  - `README.md` - Updated documentation reflecting simplified structure
- **Legacy Files**: **REMOVED** - No more version confusion or maintenance overhead
- **Next Action**: Ready for AI features, additional power-ups, or other enhancements
