✅ **Project Definition**: Clear scope, requirements, and technical approach defined
✅ **Architecture Planning**: System patterns and component relationships mapped
✅ **Technical Foundation**: Technology stack and development approach confirmed

## What's Left to Build

### Core Implementation (Not Started)
- [ ] **HTML Structure**: Basic page with Canvas element
- [ ] **CSS Styling**: Game layout and visual design
- [ ] **JavaScript Classes**: Ball, Paddle, Brick, Game controller
- [ ] **Game Loop**: RequestAnimationFrame-based update/render cycle
- [ ] **Input System**: Keyboard/mouse controls for paddle
- [ ] **Physics Engine**: Ball movement and collision detection
- [ ] **Rendering System**: Canvas drawing for all game objects

### Game Features (Not Started)
- [ ] **Paddle Movement**: Smooth left/right control
- [ ] **Ball Physics**: Realistic bouncing and velocity
- [ ] **Brick Layout**: Grid of destructible bricks
- [ ] **Collision Detection**: Ball interactions with all objects
- [ ] **Scoring System**: Points for brick destruction
- [ ] **Lives System**: Multiple attempts before game over
- [ ] **Win/Lose Conditions**: Game end states
- [ ] **Game States**: Menu, playing, paused, game over screens

### Polish and Enhancement (Future)
- [ ] **Visual Effects**: Particle effects for brick destruction
- [ ] **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for actions
- [ ] **Power-ups**: Special abilities or ball modifications
- [ ] **Multiple Levels**: Progressive difficulty
- [ ] **High Score System**: Local storage persistence
- [ ] **Mobile Support**: Touch controls for mobile devices

## Known Issues
*None yet - development hasn't started*

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (2025-01-07)
- **Single File Approach**: Chosen for simplicity and easy deployment
- **Canvas Size**: 800x600 pixels for optimal visibility and performance
- **No Dependencies**: Pure web technologies for maximum compatibility
- **Class-Based Architecture**: ES6 classes for clean, maintainable code

### Technical Constraints Established
- **Performance Target**: 60fps gameplay
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with Canvas support
- **Memory Management**: Efficient object handling in game loop
- **Code Organization**: Logical separation of concerns

## Development Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation (Planned)
**Goal**: Basic game structure with rendering
**Deliverables**:
- Working HTML5 Canvas setup
- Basic game loop running at 60fps
- Core classes defined and instantiated
- Simple rendering of game objects

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay (Planned)
**Goal**: Playable game with basic mechanics
**Deliverables**:
- Paddle control working
- Ball physics and wall bouncing
- Brick layout and destruction
- Basic collision detection

### Phase 3: Game Logic (Planned)
**Goal**: Complete game with win/lose conditions
**Deliverables**:
- Scoring system functional
- Lives and game over logic
- Win condition when all bricks destroyed
- Game state management

### Phase 4: Polish (Future)
**Goal**: Enhanced user experience
**Deliverables**:
- Visual and audio effects
- Multiple levels or difficulty
- High score persistence
- Mobile compatibility

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Plan
1. **Browser Compatibility**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
2. **Performance Testing**: Monitor FPS during intensive gameplay
3. **Gameplay Testing**: Verify all mechanics work as expected
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Test boundary conditions and error states

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Game loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] Maintains 60fps during normal gameplay
- [ ] All collisions detected accurately
- [ ] Controls feel responsive and precise
- [ ] Game can be completed (win condition reachable)
- [ ] Game over conditions work correctly

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Create index.html with basic HTML structure
2. Set up Canvas element and 2D context
3. Implement basic game loop with update/render cycle
4. Define core classes (Game, Ball, Paddle, Brick)
5. Test basic rendering and game loop functionality

## Development Notes
- Focus on getting basic functionality working before adding polish
- Test frequently in browser during development
- Keep code simple and readable
- Document any significant decisions or challenges encountered
- Update Memory Bank as development progresses
