- [ ] **Scoring**: Points awarded correctly per brick type
- [ ] **Win Condition**: Game ends when all bricks destroyed

## Power-up System Testing

### Power-up Generation
- [ ] **Drop Rates**: Wide Paddle (15%), Multi-ball (10%), Slow Ball (20%)
- [ ] **Visual Appearance**: Power-ups render with correct colors/icons
- [ ] **Movement**: Power-ups fall at appropriate speed
- [ ] **Collection**: Player can catch power-ups with paddle

### Power-up Effects
- [ ] **Wide Paddle**: Paddle width increases by 50% for 15 seconds
- [ ] **Multi-ball**: 2 additional balls spawn and behave correctly
- [ ] **Slow Ball**: Ball speed reduces by 50% for 15 seconds
- [ ] **Duration Timers**: Effects expire after correct duration
- [ ] **Visual Indicators**: Countdown timers display correctly

## AI Assistance Testing

### Metrics Tracking
- [ ] **Ball Bounces**: totalBallBounces increments on paddle hits
- [ ] **Balls Lost**: ballsLost increments when ball falls off screen
- [ ] **Bricks Hit**: bricksHit increments on brick destruction
- [ ] **Accuracy Calculation**: Formula produces correct percentages
- [ ] **Assistance Levels**: Thresholds trigger correct assistance modes

### Assistance Behaviors
- [ ] **No Help (>60%)**: No AI intervention, normal gameplay
- [ ] **Subtle Help (30-60%)**: Slightly larger collision areas, increased power-ups
- [ ] **Active Help (<30%)**: Significant assistance without being obvious
- [ ] **Seamless Integration**: Player cannot detect AI assistance
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: No FPS drops with AI features active

## Game State Testing

### State Transitions
- [ ] **Game Start**: Smooth transition from menu to gameplay
- [ ] **Game Over**: Proper handling when all lives lost
- [ ] **Win State**: Correct transition when all bricks destroyed
- [ ] **Restart**: Game resets properly for new session
- [ ] **Pause/Resume**: Game can be paused and resumed correctly

### UI Elements
- [ ] **Score Display**: Updates correctly during gameplay
- [ ] **Lives Counter**: Shows remaining lives accurately
- [ ] **Power-up Timers**: Visual countdown displays properly
- [ ] **Game Messages**: Win/lose messages appear correctly
- [ ] **Restart Button**: Functions properly in end states

## Performance Testing

### Frame Rate Monitoring
- [ ] **Stable 60fps**: Consistent frame rate during normal gameplay
- [ ] **Multi-ball Stress**: Performance with multiple balls active
- [ ] **Power-up Load**: No FPS drops when power-ups are active
- [ ] **AI Processing**: Metrics tracking doesn't impact performance
- [ ] **Extended Play**: Performance remains stable over long sessions

### Memory Management
- [ ] **No Memory Leaks**: Memory usage stays stable over time
- [ ] **Object Cleanup**: Destroyed objects are properly garbage collected
- [ ] **Event Listeners**: No accumulation of duplicate listeners
- [ ] **Canvas Operations**: Efficient drawing without memory buildup

## Browser Compatibility Testing

### Target Browsers
- [ ] **Chrome**: Latest version works perfectly
- [ ] **Firefox**: All features function correctly
- [ ] **Safari**: Canvas rendering and events work
- [ ] **Edge**: Full compatibility verified
- [ ] **Mobile Browsers**: Basic functionality on mobile devices

### Cross-Browser Issues
- [ ] **Canvas Support**: All browsers render game correctly
- [ ] **Event Handling**: Input works consistently across browsers
- [ ] **Performance**: Similar FPS across different browsers
- [ ] **Visual Consistency**: Game looks the same in all browsers

## User Experience Testing

### Gameplay Feel
- [ ] **Controls Feel Natural**: Paddle movement feels responsive
- [ ] **Ball Physics Feel Realistic**: Bouncing behavior seems natural
- [ ] **Difficulty Progression**: Game provides appropriate challenge
- [ ] **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of hits, scores, effects
- [ ] **Audio Cues**: Sound effects enhance gameplay (if implemented)

### Accessibility
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: Game playable with keyboard only
- [ ] **Visual Clarity**: All elements clearly visible and distinguishable
- [ ] **Color Contrast**: Sufficient contrast for visibility
- [ ] **Text Readability**: UI text is clear and readable

## Bug Testing Scenarios

### Edge Cases
- [ ] **Rapid Clicking**: Multiple rapid clicks don't break game
- [ ] **Window Resize**: Game handles browser window changes
