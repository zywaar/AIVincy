# AI Assistance System

## Overview
Adaptive difficulty system that tracks player performance and provides subtle assistance to struggling players without making it obvious.

## Performance Metrics Tracking

### Core Metrics
- **ballsLost**: Number of times ball fell off screen
- **bricksHit**: Total bricks destroyed by player
- **totalBallBounces**: Total ball-paddle collisions
- **paddleAccuracy**: Percentage of successful ball saves
- **timeSpent**: Total gameplay time for context

### Performance Calculation
```javascript
// Accuracy calculation
const accuracy = (totalBallBounces / (totalBallBounces + ballsLost)) * 100;

// Assistance level determination
if (accuracy > 60) return 'NO_HELP';
if (accuracy > 30) return 'SUBTLE_HELP';
return 'ACTIVE_HELP';
```

## Assistance Levels

### No Help (>60% accuracy)
- **Status**: Player performing well
- **Actions**: No AI intervention
- **Power-ups**: Normal drop rates (15%, 10%, 20%)

### Subtle Help (30-60% accuracy)
- **Paddle Collision**: Increase effective collision area by 10%
- **Power-up Timing**: Increase drop rates by 25%
- **Ball Physics**: Minor speed reduction (5%) during critical moments

### Active Help (<30% accuracy)
- **Paddle Collision**: Increase effective collision area by 20%
- **Power-up Priority**: Prioritize helpful power-ups (Wide Paddle, Slow Ball)
- **Ball Physics**: Subtle direction adjustments toward paddle
- **Drop Rates**: Double power-up frequency

## Implementation Strategy

### Metrics Collection Points
1. **Ball-Paddle Collision**: Increment totalBallBounces
2. **Ball Lost**: Increment ballsLost, calculate new accuracy
3. **Brick Destruction**: Increment bricksHit
4. **Game Loop**: Track timeSpent

### Assistance Integration
- **Collision Detection**: Modify collision bounds based on assistance level
- **Power-up System**: Adjust drop rates and type selection
- **Physics Updates**: Apply subtle modifications to ball behavior

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Impact
- Metrics tracking adds minimal overhead
- Assistance calculations only run when needed
- No visual indicators of AI assistance

### Balance Requirements
- Assistance must feel natural, not artificial
- Player should not notice they're being helped
- Maintain game challenge and satisfaction

## Testing Requirements
1. **Metrics Accuracy**: Verify all tracking points work correctly
2. **Assistance Levels**: Test each level provides appropriate help
3. **Performance Impact**: Ensure 60fps maintained with AI features
4. **Player Experience**: Assistance feels natural and unobtrusive
